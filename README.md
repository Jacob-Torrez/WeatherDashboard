## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a flexible weather monitoring system with the following capabilities:

- **Real-Time Data:** Fetch live weather metrics, including temperature, humidity, and UV index, from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Scheduled Updates:** Automate periodic weather checks for multiple locations, ensuring data is always up to date.
- **Data Persistence:** Store historical weather data in SQLite for trend analysis.
- **Visualization:** Generate time-series plots for key metrics like precipitation and temperature using Matplotlib.
- **CLI Interface:** Provide an intuitive terminal interface for users to query weather data and schedule updates.

Built with **Python** and libraries like `requests`, `sqlite3`, and `matplotlib`, this project emphasizes modular design, error handling, and scalability.

## Future Improvements

While the current functionality meets the project goals, there are several areas for potential enhancement:

1. **GUI Integration:**  
   Implement a graphical user interface using Tkinter or Plotly Dash to present weather data in a more engaging way.
2. **Advanced Analytics:**  
   Add features like anomaly detection or predictive modeling to analyze weather trends.
3. **Multi-API Support:**  
   Incorporate additional weather APIs (e.g., WeatherAPI) for data redundancy and reliability.
4. **Improved Error Handling:**  
   Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls and more user-friendly error messaging.
5. **Dockerization:**  
   Containerize the application to streamline deployment and increase portability.
